To celebrate the launch of our new community portal and blog, we are kicking off the week with our first official contest. The goal is to drive new faces to join the community.

<!-- end -->

We have had the ability to track invites for several months through the InviteManager bot, so what better idea for a contest than most referrals in one week.

All you need to do is to create an invite to the Discord server and pass it around on social media and to all of your friends interested in domain name investing or internet marketing. If they join, you get a point. At the end of the week, everyone?s points will be added up and the winner will receive $10 in Namecheap credit, good for a single .com domain or equivalent.

Good luck! üçÄ
