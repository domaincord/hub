We make a deliberate effort to have a light touch when it comes to moderating, but we do have some expectations of how our members should behave in the server.

_This is not a legal document, members should follow the spirit of these guidelines._

## For Everyone
**TL;DR** Use Common sense. 🧠 If you think you'll get a warning for it, don't do it!

🌸  Be kind and friendly to all members.

💬 Actively contribute to topical discussions, but avoid discussing things that are generally considered illegal, offensive, insulting, or disturbing.

🛑 Try to avoid conflict as much as possible in your public messages. If you happen to offend someone, politely talking to them via DM is a good way to work out any issues.

📢 We love to help you grow your business and gain loyal new customers, but please refrain from directly advertising your products or services without first asking permission from an admin.

## For Staff
**TL;DR** With great power, comes great responsibility. 🦸🏻‍♂️ Don't abuse it.

🔀  If conversations diverge too much from the channel's purpose, direct conversations to the appropriate channel in a formal, but friendly way.

💼  Conduct yourself in a professional manner at all times when posting in public channels. Remember Domaincord is a legally registered business and needs to maintain a proper image.

👨‍⚖️  Avoid showing favoritism to any single member and remain fair and just in your moderation decisions.
