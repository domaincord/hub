DomainCord is an established chat community that’s been around since August 2018, and has some etiquette guidelines that have emerged. These aren’t hard and fast rules, you won’t get banned or kicked for not following them, but keeping them in mind will help you get the most out of our chatroom community.

**EVERY MEMBER OF DOMAINCORD IS A PERSON**

This is a chatroom for hobbyist and professional domainers alike. The admins, moderators, and everyone else in DomainCord are donating their spare time; nobody’s being paid, their suggestions may not be correct, and they may not know the answer. Treat them like somebody you don’t know who’s standing next to you offering help or suggestions.

**THE CHATROOM IS ASYNC**

You may get help within 5 minutes if somebody who knows the answer is looking for something to do, but it’s entirely possible that you won’t get a response for an hour or more. If you’re asking about a less popular tool, or a specific edge case, you may even get an answer several days later.

To get the most out of DomainCord, keep it open in the background for a while after asking a question.

**SOME CHANNELS ARE MORE ACTIVE THAN OTHERS**

Questions in #general or #need-help tend to get answered quickly or pushed off the screen and forgotten. We have a handful of dedicated folks that read the scrollback and try to answer forgotten questions, but if it’s been an hour or so with no response or there’s a lot of discussion happening, you may want to re-post your question.

**DON’T PING OR DM OTHER INDIVIDUALS YOU AREN’T ACTIVELY TALKING TO**

It’s very tempting to try to get more attention to your question by @-mentioning one of the high profile (or recently active) members of DomainCord, but please don’t. They may not actually be online, they may not be able to help, and they may be in a completely different timezone–nobody likes push notifications at 3am from an impatient stranger.

Similarly, don’t DM other members without asking first. All of the same problems as @-mentioning apply, and private conversations can’t help anyone else. Your questions are likely not unique, and other people can learn from them when they are kept public.

**BE HELPFUL**

It doesn’t matter if you can’t answer a question in a brief sentence, or if you get pulled away before you can type out further replies. If a question isn’t clear, ask a clarifying question. If you remember something you read that seemed related, send a link. A lot of people who are stuck will be fine if you can’t provide the solution, they just need another place to look.

**BE POLITE**

The other people in DomainCord deserve your respect, so be polite. Not “retail employee” polite, but don’t fan flamewars, get sucked into lose-lose arguments, or other internet classics.

**BE A MODEL CHANNEL CITIZEN**

Be the change you want to see in the world! If a conversation is getting heated, try to defuse it. If a hard question is unanswered, dig in and work through it with them.

**MORE INFO**

We also have a list of guidelines that we hold our members to. We don’t kick users lightly, but repeatedly behaving contrary to these guidelines after being warned and corrected could result in you getting the boot. We reserve bans for spammers and abusive behavior.

These are some general pointers; they’re not comprehensive, and they’re not a guarantee that you’ll get answers to all your questions. We also have a Trusted designation for a small number of contributors. There aren’t set conditions you need to meet to be considered for it, the people we privately consider for it have embodied these qualities for significant amount of time. Their presence in the channel makes it a better place for everyone.
